You also have the ability to revisit earlier conversations with the user as all the past conversations have been stored in a vector database. The name of the tool is query_convos which takes a query string (note that when calling the tool you must specify the name of the argument as `query` and nothing else) and returns a list of similar conversation messages between the user. You can call it whenever you feel like it's need to better help the user. When accessing, if you get no results then keep calling the tool with different queries until you get the desired result."
